# sample-code

Here is code from a few of my assignments while studying Computer Graphics at U of T. The 'ray tracing' folder contains duplicate code from the 'ray casting' folder because the ray tracing assignment was designed to build upon the ray casting assignment. I have also added readme files and header files to provide the context for each assignment. With the exception of the 'main.cpp' files, the code in the 'source files' folder of both assignments was written by me. The 'main.cpp' files and the code in the 'header files' folder was provided by the instructor.
