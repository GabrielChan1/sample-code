# sample-code

Here is code from a few of my assignments while studying Computer Graphics at U of T. Only the 'main.cpp' files were provided by the instructor; the rest of the files were implemented by me. The 'ray tracing' folder contains duplicate code from the 'ray casting' folder because the ray tracing assignment was designed to build upon the ray casting assignment. I have also added readme files to provide the context for each assignment
